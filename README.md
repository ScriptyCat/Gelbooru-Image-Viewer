## ImageBoard Viewer/Downloader

I mean it just adds like a simple image display so you dont have to click on individual links and all that garbo.
should work fairly well. let me know. 
Has a basic image preload thing in it that should preload the images ahead of the current one to speed up the loading.
Left and right arrow keys will change image. Down arrow key downloads current image.
I wonder how many people will find this or get use out of it.

Feel free to contact me and give feedback or suggestions or tell me if something is wrong.
