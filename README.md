I mean it just adds like a simple image display so you dont have to click on individual links and all that garbo.
should work fairly well. let me know. 
Has a basic image preload thing in it that should preload the images ahead of the current one to speed up the loading.
Left and right arrow keys will change image. Down arrow key downloads current image.
I wonder how many people will find this or get use out of it.

v1.2

-Moved to github

v1.15

-Added a lot more code to make api calls to get tag info for each post at the loading of the page.

  So now when you look at an image, the tags on the left in the tag bar thing should match the image youre looking at and be 
  
  fully functional
  
-Click and drag the image to change the size.
